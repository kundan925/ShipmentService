# ShipmentService
Developed a secure RESTful backend using Spring Boot with JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization (ADMIN, CUSTOMER).  Implemented business rules where customers can create/delete their own shipments, admins can update delivery status, and all users can view shipments.
